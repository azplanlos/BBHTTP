Hotpotato is a rich wrapper for libcurl written in Objective-C. Its name derives from the not-so-common misspelling of HTTP as HPTT.

It is an ARC-only library that uses features introduced by Clang 3.1. Thus, it is only suitable for iOS 5+ and OSX 10.7+.

There are still many rough edges to polish and features missing — automatic JSON parsing and multipart uploads to name a few — to bring it up-to-par with other similar projects. I want to add those over time but help is always more than welcome so be sure to open issues for the features you'd love to see or drop me a mention @biasedbit on Twitter.
